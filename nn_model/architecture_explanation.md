# Model Architecture Explanation

The model architecture is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to process 3D voxel data. Below, I explain each component of the model in detail.


1. Convolution Layer
The architecture consists of three 3D convolutional layers:

### First Convolutional Layer (conv1):

Input: (batch_size, 1, 33, 33, 33)
Operation: nn.Conv3d(1, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
Applies 32 3D convolutional filters, each of size 3x3x3, with stride 1 and padding 1.
This layer helps to capture low-level features from the input data.
Output: (batch_size, 32, 33, 33, 33)
Activation: F.relu



### Second Convolutional Layer (conv2):

Input: (batch_size, 32, 33, 33, 33)
Operation: nn.Conv3d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
Applies 64 3D convolutional filters, each of size 3x3x3.
Captures more complex patterns and features from the data.
Output: (batch_size, 64, 33, 33, 33)
Activation: F.relu


### Third Convolutional Layer (conv3):

Input: (batch_size, 64, 33, 33, 33)
Operation: nn.Conv3d(64, 128, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
Applies 128 3D convolutional filters, each of size 3x3x3.
Extracts even higher-level features from the input data.
Output: (batch_size, 128, 33, 33, 33)
Activation: F.relu
Each convolutional layer is followed by a 3D max pooling layer to reduce the spatial dimensions, helping to decrease computational complexity and prevent overfitting:

### Max Pooling Layers (pool):
nn.MaxPool3d(2, 2): Applies a 2x2x2 max pooling operation with stride 2.
Effect: Reduces the spatial dimensions by half.
Outputs after Pooling:
After conv1: (batch_size, 32, 16, 16, 16)
After conv2: (batch_size, 64, 8, 8, 8)
After conv3: (batch_size, 128, 4, 4, 4)


2. Fully Connected Layers
After the convolutional layers, the output is flattened and passed through three fully connected (FC) layers:

### First Fully Connected Layer (fc1):

Input: Flattened tensor of shape (batch_size, 128 * 4 * 4 * 4)
128 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 8192
Operation: nn.Linear(128 * 4 * 4 * 4, 512)
Fully connected layer with 512 output units.
Output: (batch_size, 512)
Activation: F.relu

### Second Fully Connected Layer (fc2):

Input: (batch_size, 512)
Operation: nn.Linear(512, 256)
Fully connected layer with 256 output units.
Output: (batch_size, 256)
Activation: F.relu

### Third Fully Connected Layer (fc3):

Input: (batch_size, 256)
Operation: nn.Linear(256, 6)
Fully connected layer with 6 output units.
This layer outputs the predicted parameters of the line (npoints, a1, a2, a3, b1, b2).
Output: (batch_size, 6)
Model Forward Pass
Here is the complete forward pass of the model:

### Convolutional and Pooling Layers:

### Input data is passed through conv1, activated by ReLU, and max-pooled.
### The output is then passed through conv2, activated by ReLU, and max-pooled.
### The result is then passed through conv3, activated by ReLU, and max-pooled.



### Flattening:

The 3D output of the final max pooling layer is flattened into a 1D tensor to be fed into the fully connected layers.

### Fully Connected Layers:

The flattened output is passed through fc1, activated by ReLU.
The result is passed through fc2, activated by ReLU.
Finally, the output is passed through fc3 to produce the final line parameters.
